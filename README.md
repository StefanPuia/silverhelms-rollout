# Silverhelms-Rollouts
This addon is a tool that helps with loot distribution during the raid.

The benefits of this addon is that only one person needs to have it installed.
The way it works is: raiders whisper the items they want to share with the designated person that has the addon installed, they get a list of items and with the press of a button, the whole process is streamlined, raid warnings with the items, countdowns, automatic roll capture, automatic disqualification for armor types / weapons.
 
### Features
* add whispered items to a pending queue
* start any roll individually or create a rolling queue from the pending * list
* live-track the rolls
* guild ranks based priority
* declining roles for wrong gear type on MS and OS rolls
* support for any non-equippable items
* rollout history with complete roll list
* grouping items
* handling multiple winners
* detecting multiple items in whispers
* history cleanup
* pause / resume
* manual fail reason

### Known Bugs
* addon requires elvui and addonskins otherwise elements are not aligned
* pressing the group button does not take into account sockets or extra * stats
* sometimes, a "ghost" button appears that seems to be linked to the * window, but is not interactable
